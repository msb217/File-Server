Summary:
This was tested with a max file size of 115647701 bytes. Specifically, a docker
disc image file and it successfully passed PUT, PUTC, GET, and GETC - as well
as being read from the cache properly. I did not provide this file for testing in
order to not bog down the turnin process - but it is available in my home directory
/home/msb217 if you so wish to test it with that (Docker.dmg). I even went as far
as sending it back to my local machine after the transfer and reinstalling docker.

Notes:
1. MD5 Encryption is marked with the -c flag for both put and get

2. If no save_name is specified for a get request it defaults to the get_name

3. The cache is active throughout all of the tasks however it is backwards compatible
between -c and no -c. If a GETC is made on a file that was previously brought into the
with GET, the file will still have the valid checksum to fulfill the request.
